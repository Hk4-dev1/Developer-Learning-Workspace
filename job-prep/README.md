## 🤔 Technical Interview Questions

### JavaScript Fundamentals

**Q: Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`.**
```javascript
// Answer points:
// - Scope differences (function vs block)
// - Hoisting behavior
// - Reassignment rules
// - Temporal dead zone

// Example:
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted)
  var x = 1;
  
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError (temporal dead zone)
  let y = 2;
  
  const z = 3;
  // z = 4; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
}
```

**Q: What is a closure? Provide an example.**
```javascript
// A closure is when an inner function has access to variables
// from its outer (enclosing) function's scope

function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  
  return function() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

**Q: Explain event delegation in JavaScript.**
```javascript
// Instead of adding event listeners to each child element,
// add one listener to the parent and use event bubbling

document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
    console.log('Button clicked:', e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

### React Questions

**Q: What are React Hooks and why are they useful?**
```javascript
// Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId)
      .then(setUser)
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [userId]);
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;
}
```

**Q: How would you optimize a React component's performance?**
```javascript
// 1. React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{/* expensive rendering */}</div>;
});

// 2. useMemo for expensive calculations
const ExpensiveList = ({ items }) => {
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.value, 0);
  }, [items]);
  
  return <div>{expensiveValue}</div>;
};

// 3. useCallback for function references
const Parent = ({ items }) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback((id) => {
    // handle click
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => 
        <Child key={item.id} onClick={handleClick} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Python/Django Questions

**Q: Explain Django's MVT architecture.**
```python
# Model-View-Template pattern
# Model: Data layer (database models)
# View: Business logic (handles requests)
# Template: Presentation layer (HTML templates)

# models.py
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()

# views.py
def user_list(request):
    users = User.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'users.html', {'users': users})

# urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('users/', user_list, name='user_list'),
]
```

**Q: How do you handle database queries efficiently in Django?**
```python
# 1. Use select_related for foreign key relationships
users = User.objects.select_related('profile').all()

# 2. Use prefetch_related for many-to-many relationships
authors = Author.objects.prefetch_related('books').all()

# 3. Use only() to limit fields
users = User.objects.only('name', 'email').all()

# 4. Use exists() instead of checking length
if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
    # user exists

# 5. Use bulk operations for multiple records
User.objects.bulk_create([
    User(name='User1', email='user1@example.com'),
    User(name='User2', email='user2@example.com'),
])
```

### Algorithm Questions (Common)

**Q: Reverse a string**
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  // Method 1: Built-in methods
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
  
  // Method 2: Loop
  let reversed = '';
  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversed += str[i];
  }
  return reversed;
  
  // Method 3: Recursion
  if (str === '') return '';
  return reverseString(str.substr(1)) + str.charAt(0);
}
```

**Q: Find the first non-repeating character in a string**
```javascript
function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) {
  const charCount = {};
  
  // Count occurrences
  for (let char of str) {
    charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
  }
  
  // Find first non-repeating
  for (let char of str) {
    if (charCount[char] === 1) {
      return char;
    }
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

## 🎭 Behavioral Interview Questions

### STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

**Q: Tell me about a challenging project you worked on.**

**Structure your answer:**
- **Situation:** "I was building an e-commerce platform for my portfolio..."
- **Task:** "I needed to implement real-time inventory updates..."
- **Action:** "I researched WebSocket solutions and implemented Django Channels..."
- **Result:** "The feature improved user experience and prevented overselling..."

**Q: How do you handle learning new technologies?**

**Example Answer:**
"When I needed to learn TypeScript for a React project, I started by reading the official documentation and completing online tutorials. I then refactored one of my existing JavaScript projects to TypeScript, which helped me understand the practical benefits. I also joined the TypeScript community on Discord to ask questions and learn best practices. This systematic approach helped me become productive with TypeScript in about two weeks."

**Q: Describe a time when you had to debug a difficult problem.**

**Example Answer:**
"I was working on a Django application where users were experiencing intermittent login failures. The issue only occurred in production, not locally. I systematically checked logs, added additional logging, and discovered it was related to session storage configuration. I implemented Redis for session storage and added monitoring to prevent similar issues. This reduced login failures by 99% and improved overall user experience."

## 💡 System Design Questions (Junior Level)

**Q: Design a simple URL shortener (like bit.ly)**

**High-level approach:**
1. **Requirements:** Shorten URLs, redirect to original, basic analytics
2. **Database:** Store mapping between short code and original URL
3. **API Design:** POST /shorten, GET /{shortCode}
4. **Algorithm:** Generate unique short codes (base62 encoding)
5. **Caching:** Cache popular URLs in Redis
6. **Monitoring:** Track click counts and analytics

```python
# Simple Django model example
class URL(models.Model):
    original_url = models.URLField()
    short_code = models.CharField(max_length=10, unique=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    click_count = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
```
